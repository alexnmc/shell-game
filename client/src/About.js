            The shell game dates back at least to Ancient Greece.
            It can be seen in several paintings of the European Middle Ages. 
            In the 1790s, it was called "thimblerig" as it was originally played using sewing thimbles. 
            Later, walnut shells were used, and today the use of bottle caps or matchboxes is common.
            Is portrayed as a gambling game, but in reality, when a wager for money is made, it is almost always a confidence trick used to perpetrate fraud. 
            In confidence trick slang, this swindle is referred to as a short-con because it is quick and easy to pull off.
            The shell game is related to the cups and balls conjuring trick, which is performed purely for entertainment purposes without any purported gambling element.
